# IZOStore
Prototype database/backend infrastructure for IZO and other future projects. In active development

## Use at own discresion
This is specialized database software to fit my own needs, so some quality of life features may be ommited. I do not advice general usage, however possible it may be. Do remember that this is open source, so if you wish to make your own changes, updates, or bugfixes for whatever strange reason, feel free to make a PR or Fork. 

Full documentation will be added when prototyping is complete. May god have mercy on your soul
